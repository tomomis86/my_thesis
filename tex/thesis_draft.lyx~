\begin_layout Standard
Redshift-space distortions (hereafter RSDs) are a systematic anisotropy
 in galaxy distribution and are used as a dynamical probe of Cosmic Acceleration.
 By the cosmological principle, the distribution of galaxies is statistically
 isotropic (on large scales).
 The positions of galaxies are, however, measured through redshifts, which
 generates anisotropy in observed galaxy distributions due to line-of-sight
 (hereafter, LOS) peculiar velocities of galaxies.
 The effects of RSDs are seen on both small and large scales, and are known
 as the Finger-of-God effect (hereafter FoG) and the squashing effect.
 The FoG effect is due to random motions of galaxies in a virialized halo,
 while the squashing effect is caused by gravitational infall motion of
 clusters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The squashing effect was first modeled by Kaiser 1987 (

 in configuration-space) using linear perturbation theory and called the
 Kaiser approximation.
 It provides a way to measure the growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $f\approx\Omega_{m}^{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 to test the model of gravity as well as the expansion history of the Universe.
 The challenge in the measurement of the growth rate is that the Kaiser
 approximation is valid only on very large scales and therefore suffers
 from sample variance.
 In order to avoid this problem, there have been many attempts to model
 RSDs beyond linear theory both in configuration-space and Fourier-space
 by using the

On the other hand, there have been many studies attempting to recover real-space

 density field (

 through Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT).
 They estimated peculiar velocity fields of particles and shifted back the
 particles in redshift-space by their velocities to reconstruct a real-space
 density field.

In this project, we measured

 in redshift-space.

used a fixed value for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 to model the velocity field, we treated 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as a free parameter and varied it to find what 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value appropriately removes the anisotropy in redshift-space.
 he motivation behind the project is that LPT can model the non-linear density
 field on smaller scales compared to Eulerian perturbation theory (EPT)
 (

).
 So, using LPT gives us the advantage that the method is possible valid
 on smaller scales and can utilize mode number of modes to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

\begin_layout Standard
We begin this section with a derivation of Kaiser approximation and an algorithm
 for reconstruction of RSD in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Following that, we show how the reconstruction method recovers velocity
 fields/real-space density field from the redshift-space density field in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and describe how this method enables us to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for the case of DM particles and DM halos in Section

 In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 and reconstruction of real-space density.

The Kaiser approximation

 models the redshift-space distortions in linear regimes and provides a
 way to measure the growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $f\approx\Omega_{m}^{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 to constrain 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{m}$
\end_inset

 as well as to test GR/modified gravity.
 In this section, we derive the Kaiser approximation and compare its prediction
 to non-linear power spectra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When positions of galaxies are measured through redshift, the measured positions
 are slightly shifted from their actual positions due to the peculiar velocities
 of galaxies such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{s}\equiv\vec{r}+\frac{v_{z}}{H_{o}}\hat{z},\label{eq:redshift space position-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{r}$
\end_inset

 is the position in real-space, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{z}$
\end_inset

 is the line-of-sight component of the particle velocity and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{o}$
\end_inset

 is the Hubble constant.
 Here, we use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plane-parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approximation, in which the line-of-sight directions for all particles
 are assumed to be the z-axis (i.e., assuming that an observer is at infinity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conservation of mass provides 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\vec{s})d^{3}s=\rho_{r}(\vec{r})d^{3}r$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{r}$
\end_inset

 are the densities in redshift-space and real-space.
 Then, we can expand the terms in the following way.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho_{s}(\vec{s}) & = & \rho_{r}(\vec{r})\left|\frac{d^{3}r}{d^{3}s}\right|\\
 & = & \rho_{r}(\vec{r})(1+\frac{u_{z}}{z})^{-2}(1+\frac{du_{z}}{dz})^{-1}\\
 & \simeq & \rho_{r}(\vec{r})(1-\frac{du_{z}}{dz})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that going from the second to the last step is a valid approximation
 in the limit that 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{z}/z$
\end_inset

 is small, which holds in linear approximation.
 Now, take Fourier transformation of the last equation.
 The last term of the above equation becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{du_{z}}{dz}\right)_{fourier}=\mu^{2}\theta(k)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(k)\equiv(\nabla\cdot\vec{u})_{fourier}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\equiv k_{z}/k$
\end_inset

.
 In order to obtain the above relation, we assume no vorticity (i.e, the
 velocity field is irrotational) to write 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{z}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\nabla^{-2}\theta$
\end_inset

, which gives 
\begin_inset Formula $(\frac{\partial}{\partial z})^{2}\nabla^{-2})_{fourier}=(k_{z}/k)^{2}=\mu^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the first order terms for the density field in redshift-space are
 described in terms of the density field in real-space 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{r}$
\end_inset

 and the velocity divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{s}(\vec{k})=\delta_{r}(\vec{k})-\mu^{2}\theta(\vec{k}).\label{eq:Kaiser_den}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In linear perturbation theory, we can relate a density field and a velocity
 field such as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\theta(\vec{k})=-f\delta_{matter}(\vec{k})\label{eq:vel-den}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\equiv d{\rm ln}D/d{\rm ln}a\approx\Omega_{m}^{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 (Peebles 1980).
 Therefore, in the linear regime, we can relate redshift-space and real-space
 such that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{s}(\vec{k})=(1+f\mu^{2})\delta_{r}(\vec{k}).\label{eq:redshift-real}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The power spectrum in redshift-space can be related to the power spectrum
 in real-space through the growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such as 
\color black

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{s}(\vec{k})\equiv<\delta_{s}^{*}\delta_{s}>=(1+\mu^{2}f)^{2}P_{r}(k),\label{eq:Kaiser_power}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the relationship between redshift-space and real-space power spectra
 is derived from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:redshift-real"

\end_inset

.
 Note that the Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Kaiser_power"

\end_inset

 is valid for matter power spectra.
 Since a redshift-space density field has an angular dependence, we can
 expand the power spectrum by convolving with Legendre polynomials, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{l}(\mu)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{s}(k,\mu)=\underset{l}{\sum}P^{(l)}(k)L_{l}(\mu),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{s}^{(l)}(k)\equiv\frac{2l+1}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1}P_{s}(k,\mu)L_{l}(\mu)d\mu.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 through the Kaiser approximation, we first take a ratio of quadrupole and
 monopole moments of a redshift-space power spectrum:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{s}^{(2)}/P_{s}^{(0)}=(\frac{4}{3}f+\frac{4}{7}f^{2})/(1+\frac{2}{3}f+\frac{1}{5}f^{2}),\label{eq:kaiser_ratio}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and measure the ratio to obtain the value for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.

 In order to measure the value of

 Both measured

 values from the cosmology used in the simulations, which are

=0.84 at

 The main cause of this underestimation is due to the fact that the ratio
 of non-linear matter power spectrum already deviates from the Kaiser approximat

Now, we repeat the same exercise for DM halos whose masses are greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
 DM halos and galaxies are biased tracer of DM particles, which means that
 the density for those biased tracers are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{halo/gal}=b\delta_{DM}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is a bias parameter.
 On large scales, this bias parameter is scale-independent and therefore
 can be treated as the constant parameter.
 Measuring the Kaiser approximation through such biased tracers, the ratio
 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

 Note that the bias parameter is scale-dependent on small scales, and therefore
 it adds one more complication in the measurement of the value of

In this section, we present the algorithm to reconstruct the real-space
 density field from redshift-space through shifting the particle positions
 back by the distance due to their velocities.
 This reconstruction naturally provides a description in terms of LPT.
 The motivation behind of this method is that LPT takes care of higher-order
 terms as shown in the previous section, and therefore the reconstruction
 can remove anisotropy in redshift-space beyond the regime the Kaiser approximat
ion is valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to reconstruct real-space density, we need to remove anisotropy
 generated by LOS components of peculiar velocities.
 So, the crucial step in our reconstruction method is that particles in
 redshift-space are shifted back by their peculiar velocities calculated

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimating velocity fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we present how well linear perturbation theory can estimate
 the velocity fields.
 To do that, we first compute velocity fields using the volume-weighted
 method, which defines velocities by dividing momentum by mass on each grid.
 Note that the volume-weighted velocities are sensitive to grid sizes, because
 large number of grids make a majority of grids empty and therefore the
 velocities on those grids are zero even though the velocity field is not.
 To avoid having ill-defined velocities, we used 
\begin_inset Formula $128^{3}$
\end_inset

 grids here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we estimate linear velocities using the density fields from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:linear_velocity"

\end_inset

.
 Here, we decide to use two different density fields -- the real-space density
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{r}$
\end_inset

 and the Kaiser density 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{{\rm Kaiser}}$
\end_inset

 defined as Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Kaiser2"

\end_inset

.
 The reason we use those two density fields to compute linear velocities
 is because we cannot observe the real-space density field and need to use
 the Kaiser density in actual observations, but we also want to know how
 the estimated velocity fields differ by using those different density fields.

Power spectra with reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By comparing the velocity/density fields in the previous sections, we show
 that the reconstruction method can recover the real-space density field
 better than the Kaiser approximation.
 Now, we present at what scales the power spectrum computed from the reconstruct
ed density field agrees with the power spectrum in real space.
 To this end, we applied the reconstruction method to the redshift-space
 density field and then computed the power spectrum.

\end_inset

, to the real/redshift-space power spectra at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 While the Kaiser approximation agrees with the power spectrum in redshift-space
 up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{{\rm max}}\sim0.05h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

, the reconstructed power spectrum agrees with the real-space power spectrum
 up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{{\rm max}}\sim0.1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{r}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

 We computed the cross correlation coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 using the power spectra such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{<\delta_{{\rm recon}}^{*}\delta_{r}>}{<\delta_{{\rm recon}}^{*}\delta_{{\rm recon}}><\delta_{r}^{*}\delta_{r}>}=\frac{P_{{\rm recon},r}^{(cross)}}{P_{{\rm recon}}^{(auto)}P_{r}^{(auto)}},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{(auto)}$
\end_inset

 is an auto power spectrum and 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{(cross)}$
\end_inset

 is a cross power spectrum.
 Having 1 for cross correlation coefficients means that those two density
 fields are perfectly correlated each other.
 The cross correlation coefficient for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{{\rm recon}}$
\end_inset

 is closer to 1 on smaller scale than that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{{\rm Kaiser}}$
\end_inset

, which is consistent with Figure

In Section

, we demonstrate that reconstruction can recover real-space density from
 redshift-space on large scales.
 In this section, we treat 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as a free parameter and demonstrate the accuracy with which we can measure
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value through reconstruction.
 We hypothesize that the proper 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value will permit our reconstruction to successfully remove all of the
 anisotropy from redshift-space.
 In order to identify the proper 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value, we assess residual anisotropy by calculating the quadrupole moment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $f/\beta$

 value through reconstruction for DM particles and DM halos.

\begin_layout Standard
Using the algorithm described in Sec.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Algorithm"

\end_inset

, we first reconstruct the density field with various values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we computed the quadrupole moments from those reconstructed density
 fields.
 Here, we want to find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, which removes anisotropy on large scales.
 In order to find such a value, we calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 of those quadrupole moments with respect to zero:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(P_{{\rm recon,i}}^{(2)}(k_{j}))^{2}}{\sigma(k_{j})^{2}},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N}\{(P_{{\rm recon,i}}^{(2)})^{2}/N-(\bar{P}_{{\rm recon}}^{(2)})^{2}\}$
\end_inset

.
 This will allow us to find the correct 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value, which makes the quadrupole moment zero.
 The underlying assumption is that if a chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 value does not properly recover real-space density through reconstruction,
 there must be some residual anisotropy from redshift-space density and
 quadrupole moments evaluate this residual anisotropy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We computed the quadrupole moments for the reconstructed density fields
 with various values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 and their corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

 as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $10h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{{\rm recon}}$

 The 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value corresponding to the cosmology used for the simulation is shown as
 the red solid line, while the quadrupole moment of the real-space density
 field is shown as a red dashed line.
 This figure tells us two things.
 One is that the reconstruction method removes anisotropy up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.05h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

 which is better than the Kaiser approximation.
 The other thing is that the proper 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value overestimates the velocity field and therefore over-removes the anisotrop
y.
 This is consistent with the right panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:recon-ratio-quad-1"

\end_inset

 , which shows the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 values for various

 The corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 value for the minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $f=0.455$

 This yields a 
\begin_inset Formula $1.1\%$

 measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

\begin_layout Standard
In light of our findings that the reconstructed quadrupoles largely deviate
 from the real-space quadrupole moment on small scales, we wondered whether
 this is due to failing to model the FoG effect or due to a choice of smoothing
 scales.
 We therefore apply the reconstruction method with various smoothing scales
 and the fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, and compute the quadrupole moments as shown in Figure 
\color black

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:power-smoothing1"

\end_inset

 .
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:power-smoothing1"

\end_inset

 tells us that the reconstruction method is sensitive to the choice of smoothing
 scales.
 For the case of the smoothing scale of 
\begin_inset Formula $20h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, the effect of RSDs on small scales remain and the anisotropy is not completely
 removed even on large scales.
 This is because large smoothing scales kill the high-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 modes and therefore cannot model small scale velocities.
 On the other hand, for the case of smoothing scales of 
\begin_inset Formula $5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, the velocities are over-estimated on all scales and the quadrupole moment
 goes to negative; however, the amplitude is almost flat up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

.
 This implies that using the smoothing scale of 
\begin_inset Formula $5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 will introduce larger bias on the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, but we can use more modes (i.e., going to smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

) in the measurement.
 Due to the sensitivity of the reconstruction on smoothing scales, we conclude
 that the deviation of the reconstructed quadrupoles on small scales is
 mainly due to the choice of smoothing scales.

 Note that none of the crucial aspects are lost with this simplification.

 The only difference is that now we measure the value of

 The reason we also show the result using the reconstructed power spectrum
 is because we cannot use the real-space power spectrum in real observations.
 People often use the angular correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{p}(r_{p})$
\end_inset

 to measure the bias; however, the angular correlation function introduces
 a systematic bias in the measurement (

).
 The figure tells us that we can measure the bias using the reconstructed
 power spectrum.

 Quantitatively, the biases measured through the real-space power spectrum
 are 1.53 (with the error of the mean of 0.02) and 3.18 (with the error of
 0.04) at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we measure the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 using the reconstruction method, which naturally provides a description
 in terms of LPT.
 The motivation behind this study is that LPT can model the non-linearity
 of the density field on smaller scales that EPT (i.e., the reconstruction
 method enables us to use more modes in 
\begin_inset Formula $P(k)$
\end_inset

 to measure the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method, however, underestimates the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 for the case of DM particles, which yields a 
\begin_inset Formula $1.1\%$
\end_inset

 measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, but with a residual bias of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.4\%$
\end_inset

.
 For the case of DM halos, the method overestimates the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 with a residual bias of 
\begin_inset Formula $10.0\%$
\end_inset

.
 This may be because we use the non-linear density field to estimate the
 linear velocity fields, but we are uncertain about the cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have been several studies trying to reconstruct velocity fields from
 the density field beyond linear perturbation theories.
 Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "kitaura_2012"

\end_inset

 shows that using the tidal tensors successfully recovers velocity fields
 on scales greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

.
 Although using higher-order terms require more number of free parameters
 (unless assuming certain cosmologies), this may be a way to correct the
 residual bias in the measurement.

\begin_layout Chapter
Scale-Dependence of Halo Assembly Bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two-point clustering of dark matter halos is influenced by halo properties
 besides mass, a phenomenon referred to as 
\shape italic
halo assembly bias
\shape default
.
 Using the depth of the gravitational potential well, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

, as our secondary halo property, in this paper we present the first study
 of the scale-dependence of assembly bias.
 In the large-scale linear regime, 
\begin_inset Formula $r\geq10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc},$
\end_inset

 our findings are in keeping with previous results.
 In particular, at the low-mass end (
\begin_inset Formula $<\mcoll\approx10^{12.5}\msun$
\end_inset

), halos with high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 show stronger large-scale clustering relative to halos with low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 of the same mass; this trend weakens and reverses for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir\gtrsim\mcoll.$
\end_inset

 In the nonlinear regime, assembly bias in low-mass halos exhibits a pronounced
 scale-dependent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bump
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $500\kpch-5\mpch$
\end_inset

.
 This feature weakens and eventually vanishes for halos of higher mass.
 We show that this scale-dependent signature can primarily be attributed
 to a special subpopulation of
\shape italic
 ejected halos
\shape default
, defined as present-day host halos that were previously members of a higher-mas
s halo at some point in their past history.
 A corollary of our results is that galaxy clustering on scales of 
\begin_inset Formula $r\sim1-2\mpch$
\end_inset

 can be impacted by up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim15\%$
\end_inset

 by the choice of the halo property used in the halo model, even for stellar
 mass-limited samples.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The halo model provides a connection between dark matter halos and galaxies,
 and it has been remarkably successful in describing observations of galaxy
 clustering (for a recent review, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "seljak00,vdboschBOOK"

\end_inset

).
 In particular, the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "berlind02,berlind03"

\end_inset

 and the Conditional Luminosity Function (CLF) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "yang03"

\end_inset

 are the two most widely used models of the galaxy-halo connection.
 These models start from the assumption that halo mass completely determines
 the galaxy occupation statistics.
 In order to populate halos with galaxies, the HOD specifies the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(N|M)$
\end_inset

 that a halo with mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 hosts 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 galaxies, while the CLF models the mean abundance 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(L|M)$
\end_inset

 of galaxies with luminosity 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in halos of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 These two models are interchangeable; integrating the CLF over luminosity
 yields an HOD.
 Both models have been applied extensively to observations in order to study
 the galaxy-halo connection

However, the clustering of halos also exhibits a dependence on additional
 properties beyond their mass 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gao_etal05,wechsler06,gao_white07,li_etal08,hahn_etal09"

\end_inset

, a phenomenon generically referred to as 
\shape italic
halo assembly bias
\shape default
.
 This can be traced back to the fact that halos of the same mass in different
 environments have different assembly histories and cluster differently.
 Having different assembly histories also affects the internal structure
 of halos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bullock01,wechsler02,hahn_etal07b,faltenbacher_white10"

\end_inset

.
 This, in turn, results in a clustering dependence on the structural properties
 of a halo, including the depth of its gravitational potential well, characteriz
ed by its maximum circular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

.
 The present work revisits this manifestation of halo assembly bias, and
 extends it down to smaller scales (
\begin_inset Formula $<10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

) than has been previously explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach to connecting halos and galaxies is abundance matching
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "kravtsov04a,vale_ostriker04,vale_ostriker06,tasitsiomi_etal04,conroy_wechsler09,guo10,simha10,neistein11a,watson_etal12b,rod_puebla12,hearin_etal12b,kravtsov13,saito15"

\end_inset

.
 In its simplest form, abundance matching posits a monotonic relationship
 between a property of a galaxy (luminosity, stellar mass) and that of a
 halo (mass, potential well depth).
 By construction, such a relationship preserves the rank ordering of the
 galaxies and halos.
 The choice of the observationally-relevant halo property is a priori unknown;
 this uncertainty that can lead to significant systematic errors when using
 halo models to interpret galaxy clustering measurements

\begin_layout Standard
A recent parallel research effort has been revisiting the standard subdivision
 of dark matter halos into host/sub-halos, a classification that naturally
 depends on how the halo boundary is chosen.
 While the virial radius is the most commonly chosen definition, recent
 work has demonstrated that the environmental effects of halos extends well
 beyond the virial radius 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In particular, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wetzel_etal13"

\end_inset

 argue that these environmental effects are due to ejected subhalos which
 orbit beyond the virial radius of their hosts, and therefore get temporarily
 reclassified as host halos.
 These studies argue that a more physically motivated boundary is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 corresponding to the caustic from material just reaching its first apocentric
 passage.
 One of the chief results of the present work is that the halo assembly
 bias on small scales predominantly arises from this mis-classification.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the standard classification of halos into host halos (not
 within the virial radius of a more massive halo) and subhalos (within the
 virial radius of a more massive halo), we further classify host halos into
 ejected and non-ejected halos.
 Ejected halos, also referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backsplash
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 halos, are host halos whose main progenitor was classified, at some point
 in its merger tree history, as a subhalo.
 As we discuss below, these ejected halos have very different clustering
 properties compared to their non-ejected counterparts.
 The ejected fraction for the Bolshoi simulation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim15.8\%$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{11}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$

, and drops to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim6.3\%$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

.
 The lower mass resolution of the MultiDark simulation prevents us from
 making this additional sub-classification.
 Accordingly, results that rely on this split are restricted to the Bolshoi
 simulation and mass range.

 We find that our analytical approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\meanvmax(\mvir)$
\end_inset

 gives a good description of the true median: for any fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir,$
\end_inset

 the high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 and low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Note that Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows a sharp lower bound on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 at a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir,$
\end_inset

 but no sharp upper bound.
 This is ultimately due to the halo mass definition.
 The circular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm cir}}$
\end_inset

 at the virial radius of any halo is 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm cir}}(\rvir)\equiv V_{{\rm vir}}=\sqrt{G\mvir/\rvir}.$
\end_inset

 Since the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 tabulated in the halo catalog is computed as the maximum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm cir}}$
\end_inset

 over the entire profile of the halo, formally 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 cannot exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm vir}}.$

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we present our primary results for the clustering properties
 of halos as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax.$
\end_inset

 Clustering strength is quantified by the two-point correlation function,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(r).$
\end_inset

 In all that follows, we will use 
\begin_inset Formula $\ximm(r)$
\end_inset

 to denote the auto-correlation of the dark matter density field with itself,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xihm(r)$
\end_inset

 to denote the cross-correlation between a sample of halos and the underlying
 density field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Halos are biased tracers of the dark matter density field.
 We denote this bias as 
\begin_inset Formula $\bh,$
\end_inset

 which is in general a function of spatial separation.
 We define halo bias as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\bh(r)\equiv\xihm(r)/\ximm(r).
\]

\end_inset

On sufficiently large scales halo bias is approximately linear, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bh(r)$
\end_inset

 approaches a constant value 
\begin_inset Formula $\bhlin.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to measure the bias of a sample of simulated halos for both Bolshoi
 and MultiDark simulations, we estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\ximm(r)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\xihm(r)$
\end_inset

 using a random down-sampling of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 dark matter particles.
 For a given sample of halos, we estimate the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bhlin$
\end_inset

 exhibited by the sample as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
b_{{\rm lin}}=\frac{1}{N_{{\rm bin}}}\sum_{i}(\xi_{{\rm hm}}(r_{i})/\xi_{{\rm mm}}(r_{i})).\label{eq:blindef}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:blindef"

\end_inset

, the sum is performed over 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{{\rm bin}}=20$
\end_inset

 separation bins 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{{\rm i}}$
\end_inset

 linearly spaced from 
\begin_inset Formula $10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $20h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to study the mass-dependence of halo bias, we bin our halos into
 a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir$
\end_inset

 bins chosen such that there are the same numbers of halos in each bin.
 For MultiDark, we select 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times10^{5}$
\end_inset

 halos for each bin; for Bolshoi we use 
\begin_inset Formula $25000$
\end_inset

 halos per bin.
 The halos in each mass bin are categorized as high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 or low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 according to the method described in Sec.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:samples"

\end_inset

.
 We start using halos from the MultiDark simulation for 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}>10^{12.2}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top panel of Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\bhlin$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir;$
\end_inset

 results for high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos are shown in blue, low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos in green.
 At the low-mass end, linear bias is a weak function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir;$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}\gtrsim\mcoll\approx10^{12.8}\msun,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mcoll$
\end_inset

 is a characteristic mass scale for clustering corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(\mcoll,z)=\delta_{c}\approx1.69$
\end_inset

, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bhlin$
\end_inset

 increases sharply with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir.$
\end_inset

 Thus the basic shape of each curve in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:linear-bias"

\end_inset

 is in accord with theoretical expectations from the peak-background split

\end_inset

 formalism and Press-Schechter theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 By comparing the blue and green curves in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:linear-bias"

\end_inset

 we can see that linear bias has significant dependence upon 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 for halos of the same mass.
 This dependence is most readily seen in the bottom panel, which shows the
 ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bhlin$
\end_inset

 of high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 samples divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bhlin$
\end_inset

 of low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 samples.
 Thus in the bottom panel of Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:linear-bias"

\end_inset

, vertical axis values exceeding unity correspond to masses where high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos cluster more strongly relative to their low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the low-mass end, high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos are more strongly clustered than low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos of the same mass.
 The clustering difference increases with decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir,$
\end_inset

 and exceeds 
\begin_inset Formula $30\%$
\end_inset

 for halos of Milky Way mass 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir\approx10^{12}\msun.$
\end_inset

 At the high-mass end, the trend reverses, and the overall magnitude is
 weaker.
 These results are consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wechsler06"

\end_inset

, who find that the same trends hold when the secondary halo property is
 NFW concentration, rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax.$
\end_inset

 This agreement is to be expected: insofar as the halo profile is well-approxima
ted by an NFW profile, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 is entirely determined by concentration (see Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:vmax-mvir"

\end_inset

).
 Note that there is a drop in the ratio of the linear biases on the low-mass
 end.
 As we see no physical reason for this drop, we consider this to be a resolution
 effect and suggest that the completeness requirements for two-halo-property-dep
endent clustering are significantly more stringent relative to the requirements
 demanded by the need for a complete halo mass/velocity function.

Next, we study the scale-dependence of halo bias on small scales for high-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 and low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 halos.
 We wish to parse the novel, small-scale effects from the well-known large-scale
 effects.
 So for each sample of high- and low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 halos, we compute the following quantity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{b}_{{\rm h}}(r|\mvir;\vmax)\equiv b_{{\rm h}}(r|\mvir;\vmax)/b_{{\rm lin}}(\mvir;\vmax).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus for any sample of halos, as 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gtrsim10\mpch,$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{b}_{{\rm h}}(r)\rightarrow1,$
\end_inset

 by construction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top panel of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{b}_{h}(r)$
\end_inset

 of high-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 samples divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{h}(r)$
\end_inset

 of low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 samples for several mass bins.
 The first three mass bins labeled in the figure, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=10^{11.7,12.0,12.2}h^{-1}{\rm {\rm M_{\odot}}}$
\end_inset

, are from the Bolshoi simulation, and the last two mass bins, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=10^{12.7,13.1}h^{-1}{\rm {\rm M_{\odot}}}$
\end_inset

, are from the MultiDark simulation.
 High-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 halos cluster more strongly compared to their low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 counterparts at 
\begin_inset Formula $1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

.
 This scale-dependent feature becomes stronger with decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and exceeds 40% for halos of Milky Way mass and reaches 60% at 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}\approx10^{11.7}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the reverse trend at small scales 
\begin_inset Formula $r<1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, where low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 halos seem to cluster more strongly, is an artifact of the normalization
 by the linear biases.
 The ratio without normalization goes to one at small scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Up until present, we have used both host halos and ejected halos to compute
 halo biases.
 Both types of halos are identified as distinct halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Ejected halos, however, are halos which were identified as part of more
 massive halos at one or more occasions in the past, but were ejected and
 now exist as a host halo at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

.
 Those ejected halos tend to exist around more massive halos (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wetzel_etal13,wang09"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the effect on scale-dependent biases may be caused by those
 ejected halos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test this ejected halo hypothesis, we compute halo-matter cross correlation
 functions after first excluding the subpopulation of ejected halos.
 Our results for the linear regime are shown as the dashed curves in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:linear-bias"

\end_inset

.
 The relative difference in the linear bias between high-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 and low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 halos is suppressed to 25% for halos of Milky Way mass.
 This suppression due to excluding the ejected halos is consistent with
 the results presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Section
Observational Consequences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider possible observational consequences of the results of the
 previous section.
 In order to do this, the key first step is to relate an observable property
 of a galaxy (luminosity, stellar mass) to an intrinsic property of its
 host halo (mass, circular velocity).
 As one might infer from above (and we demonstrate below), different choices
 for the latter can result in significant differences for different observables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to be explicit, we use the abundance matching technique 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kravtsov04a,vale_ostriker04,vale_ostriker06,tasitsiomi_etal04,conroy_wechsler09,guo10,simha10,neistein11a,watson_etal12b,rod_puebla12,hearin_etal12b,kravtsov13,saito15"

\end_inset

 to connect the stellar masses of central galaxies to either the mass or
 circular velocity of host halos.
 We implement this by splitting the halo catalog into a series of bins with
 constant number density (=
\begin_inset Formula $1.6\times10^{-3}(h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{-3}$
\end_inset

), rank ordering either by mass or circular velocity.
 We label each bin by its corresponding stellar mass, computed from the
 stellar-to-halo mass relation of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "behroozi13"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that when we rank order based on circular velocity, there is the possibilit
y that the mean halo masses of these bins could differ from what we obtain
 after rank ordering by halo mass.
 We explicitly check this and find that the mean halo masses for both cases
 agree to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim99.6\%$
\end_inset

, allowing us to consistently compare samples of mock central galaxies with
 the same stellar mass, but where the stellar mass is statistically regulated
 by either 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find only a relatively minor difference in the large-scale clustering
 of the two samples of mock central galaxies.
 At fixed stellar mass, the linear bias of samples selected by their circular
 velocity are 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5\%$
\end_inset

 higher than samples selected by halo mass.
 This decreases to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim2\%$
\end_inset

 if we remove ejected halos from both samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We study the scale-dependence of the clustering of our mock central galaxies
 in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Again we see a clear scale-dependence of the clustering signal, with a

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$

For halos

 we have shown that the linear bias of low-

 halos is larger relative to high-

\end_inset

 halos of the same mass.
 As shown in

, this phenomenon is nicely explained in terms of the statistics of fluctuations
 in a Gaussian random field.
 Consider two halos with the same present-day mass, but with different concentra
tion.
 Both halos originate from a fluctuation of the same peak height, but with
 different peak curvature: the high-concentration (high-

 with a configuration space filter is that low-curvature peaks cluster more
 strongly relative to high-curvature peaks of the same height.
 In closely related work,

 This is a well-founded assumption at the high-mass end, and we see that
 the predictions are in good agreement with simulations in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir>\mcoll$
\end_inset

 regime 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dalal_etal08"

\end_inset

.
 The situation is quite different when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir\lesssim\mcoll.$
\end_inset

 We have confirmed previous results (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wechsler06"

\end_inset

) that large-scale assembly bias changes sign and strengthens for lower-mass
 halos.
 This is in stark contrast to the EPS model described above, which makes
 the same prediction for assembly bias regardless of halo mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus EPS succeeds and fails in precisely the regimes where we expect.
 Lower-mass halos are strongly influenced by the tidal field in which they
 evolve 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hahn_etal07b,wang_etal11,shi15,hahn_etal09,hearin_etal15"

\end_inset

; the EPS assumption that the halo dominates its environment breaks down
 catastrophically, and in this regime nonlinear evolution governs assembly
 bias.
 On the other hand, high-mass halos 
\shape italic
do
\shape default
 dominate their tidal environment; the EPS assumption holds good, and we
 can understand assembly bias as naturally arising from the statistics of
 Gaussian fluctuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results on the scale-dependence of assembly bias are also consistent
 with this picture.
 First, we remind the reader that halo bias for high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos shows non-trivial scale dependence with a pronounced bump at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1-2\mpch$
\end_inset

 compared to the bias for low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos.
 This scale-dependent feature for high-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos becomes 60% larger compared to low-
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 halos at 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}\approx10^{11.7}\msun$
\end_inset

.
 This feature, however, is removed by excluding the ejected halos, implying
 that this special sub-population is responsible for the scale-dependent
 bump.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This scale-dependence has a simple interpretation in terms of subhalo back-splas
hing.
 First, ejected halos are physically associated with the more massive halo
 from which they were ejected.
 The clustering of ejected halos is therefore largely determined by this
 associated massive halo, much like the clustering of present-day subhalos
 is determined by their host halo.
 Second, as ejected halos pass near and inside a massive halo, their physical
 growth is arrested, and many such halos even experience substantial mass
 loss 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wang09,sinha12,wetzel_etal13,sinha15"

\end_inset

.
 This arrested development has a greater impact on the outer layers of the
 halo, so that the ejected halo's mass is significantly more affected than
 its circular velocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "behroozi13c"

\end_inset

.
 Putting these two effects together, we should naturally expect the outskirts
 of massive groups and clusters to be preferentially populated with low-mass
 halos that have above-average values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vmax$
\end_inset

 for their mass.
 This manifests in the scale-dependent bump shown in Figures

Recent advances in our understanding of halo growth sheds further light
 on the above results.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "diemer14,adhikari14,wetzel_nagai14,more15"

\end_inset

, the natural physical boundary of a dark matter halo is the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

splashback radius", which is the radius where accreted matter reaches its
 first apocenter after turnaround, and is roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $2-3\rvir.$
\end_inset

 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, the halos of massive groups and clusters (
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir\gtrsim10^{13}\msun,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\rvir\gtrsim500\kpch$
\end_inset

) are surrounded by a large fraction of ejected halos.
 For ejected halos with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mvir\approx10^{11.7}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 halos, the host-centric spatial distribution of the ejected population
 peaks at 
\begin_inset Formula $r\approx1.25R_{{\rm 200m}}\approx1.5\mpch$
\end_inset

 (see Figs.
 2 and 3 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

).
 The bump feature we find at 
\begin_inset Formula $1-2\mpch$
\end_inset

 is therefore in quantitative agreement with the results 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wetzel_etal13,wang_mo_jing08"

\end_inset

: this bump occurs at the same physical scale that we would expect if the
 clustering of the ejected population is largely determined by the host
 to which the halos are ultimately bound.
 Note that the assembly bias on large scales, 
\begin_inset Formula $r\gtrsim10\mpch,$
\end_inset

 is not dominated by the ejected halos, which is consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

.
 Without the ejected halos, the relative difference in the linear bias between
 high-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 and low-
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}$
\end_inset

 halos remains 25% for halos of Milky Way mass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to explore possible observational consequences of our findings,
 we use abundance matching relating a stellar mass of central galaxies to
 either mass or circular velocity of host halos.
 Using different intrinsic properties for host halos results in significant
 differences in clustering signals of central galaxies.
 On large scales, the linear bias of samples selected by their circular
 velocities are 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5\%$
\end_inset

 higher than samples selected by halo masses at fixed stellar mass.
 Without the ejected halos, this differences is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim2\%$
\end_inset

.
 On small scales (
\begin_inset Formula $r<10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

), samples selected by their circular velocities exhibit the scale dependence
 with a bump at 
\begin_inset Formula $1-2h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 compared to samples selected by halo masses.
 This scale-dependent bump for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}-$
\end_inset

selected samples becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim15\%$
\end_inset

 with the ejected halos and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim5\%$
\end_inset

 without the ejected halos.
 As these effects are roughly as large as existing SDSS clustering measurements
 on these scales, this raises the possibility that clustering measurements
 can be used to determine which host halo property is the true statistical
 regulator of the stellar mass of the central galaxy residing in the halo.

Efficient Construction of Mock Catalogs for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
 Surveys
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precision measurements of the large scale structure of the Universe require
 large numbers of high fidelity mock catalogs to accurately assess, and
 account for, the presence of systematic effects.
 We introduce and test a scheme for generating mock catalogs rapidly using
 suitably derated N-body simulations.
 Our aim is to reproduce the large scale structure and the gross properties
 of dark matter halos with high accuracy, while sacrificing the details
 of the halo's internal structure.
 By adjusting global and local time-steps in an N-body code, we demonstrate
 that we recover halo masses to better than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\%$
\end_inset

 and the power spectrum (both in real and redshift space, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

) to better than 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

, while requiring a factor of 4 less CPU time.
 We also calibrate the redshift spacing of outputs required to generate
 simulated light cones.
 We find that outputs separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.05$
\end_inset

 allow us to interpolate particle positions and velocities to reproduce
 the real and redshift space power spectra to better than 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 (out to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

).
 We apply these ideas to generate a suite of simulations spanning a range
 of cosmologies, motivated by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
 (BOSS) but broadly applicable to future large scale structure surveys including
 eBOSS and DESI.
 As an initial demonstration of the utility of such simulations, we calibrate
 the shift in the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak position as a function
 of galaxy bias with higher precision than has been possible so far.
 This paper also serves to document the simulations, which we make publicly
 available.

 Based on these successes, a new generation of surveys

 is being planned that will improve cosmological constraints by an order
 of magnitude (or more).
 This unprecedented increase in statistical precision places stringent demands
 on the underlying theoretical modeling and analysis techniques; numerical
 simulations will play an essential role in meeting these requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One set of challenges for simulations arise from the varied roles they play,
 and the different requirements these impose in turn on the simulations.
 At one extreme, simulations are necessary for estimating the errors on
 the measurements.
 This typically requires very large volumes to simulate entire surveys thousands
 of times, but have lower accuracy requirements.
 Motivated by these considerations, a number of recent studies have investigated
 methods designed to produce mock catalogs with reduced accuracy, but much
 higher throughput compared to full N-body simulations

 The effect of changing the input cosmology used to generate the covariance

 it clear how best to implement such variations (but see Refs.

 for recent work on this topic).
 More recently, the impact of super-survey modes (modes outside the survey
 volume) on inferred errors has been shown to be potentially larger than
 previously appreciated (e.g., Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2013PhRvD..87l3504T"

\end_inset

) and is an area of active study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the other extreme, simulations are crucial for calibrating the theoretical
 models used to fit the data.
 Examples here are quantifying shifts in the baryon acoustic oscillation
 distance scale due to nonlinear evolution and galaxy bias 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, or templates used to fit the full shape of the galaxy correlation function.
 For such applications, one ideally requires high fidelity simulations.
 The volume requirements are significantly reduced from that for covariance
 matrices, but the simulations still need to cover volumes much larger than
 survey volumes to keep systematic errors below statistical errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An intermediate application is the generation of mock catalogs that capture
 the observational characteristics of surveys (e.g., geometry, selection effects).
 The importance of these cannot be underestimated, since the effects of
 many observational systematics can only be quantitatively estimated by
 simulating them.
 These issues will become progressively more important for the next generations
 of surveys which will move away from highly complete and pure samples that
 have mostly been used for cosmological studies to date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest way to generate approximate density fields is to use analytic
 approximations such as Lagrangian perturbation theory followed by prescriptions
 that place halos within the density field to match the halo distribution
 measured in N-body simulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2013MNRAS.428.1036M,2014arXiv1401.4171M"

 time-steps 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "2013JCAP...06..036T"

\end_inset

, or a combination of the two approaches 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "2014MNRAS.437.2594W"

\end_inset

.
 These methods are successful in capturing the large-scale density field
 but lose information on small scales.
 Because of their speed, they can be used to produce large numbers of simulation
s required to build sample covariance matrices, at error levels ranging
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $5-10\%$
\end_inset

 (depending on the quantities being predicted).
 It is difficult to estimate, however, what the loss of accuracy implies
 for tests of systematic errors, which may need to be modeled at the 
\begin_inset Formula $<1\%$
\end_inset

 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach we take here is to reduce the small spatial scale accuracy
 of a high-resolution N-body code by coarsening its temporal resolution.
 For the code we consider, the time-stepping consists of two components,
 (i) a long time step for solving for the evolution under the long-range
 particle-mesh (PM) force, and (ii) a set of underlying sub-cycled time
 steps for a short-range particle-particle interaction, computed either
 via a tree-based algorithm, or by direct particle-particle force evaluations.
 The idea is to reduce the number of both types of time steps while preserving
 enough accuracy to correctly describe the large scale distribution of galaxies,
 as modeled by a halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach.
 One goal in this paper is, therefore, to quantitatively understand the
 impact of the temporal resolution on the halo density field and how to
 accurately reproduce the details of the halo density field on large scales,
 while sacrificing small scale structure information.
 Doing this successfully allows us to generate a suite of large volume simulatio
ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having determined the optimal time-stepping that maintains accuracy on the
 scales of interest, we then generate a suite of simulations using this
 procedure.
 We use these simulations to demonstrate two example applications discussed
 above.
 The first example addresses the generation of mock catalogs for spectroscopic
 surveys.
 We focus on the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), although
 these simulations can be used to simulate aspects of future surveys such
 as eBOSS and DESI.
 The gains from optimizing our time-stepping allow us to simulate a volume
 large enough to embed two entire BOSS volumes into the same simulation.
 As part of building these mock catalogs, we also consider the frequency
 with which we need to store snapshots of the N-body simulation in order
 to include light-cone effects in the mocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our second application highlights the usefulness of these techniques for
 constraining systematic effects: we use the simulations to constrain shifts
 in the BAO acoustic scale as a function of halo bias.
 This requires very large volumes to statistically measure the shifts, while
 at the same time, one must robustly determine the halo properties as well.
 Although we restrict ourselves here to a simple demonstration, our results
 show an unambiguous shift in the BAO scale due to a combination of nonlinear
 evolution of the density field, as well as halo bias.

HACC uses a hybrid parallel algorithmic structure, splitting the force calculati
on into a specially designed grid-based long/medium range spectral particle
 mesh (PM) component that is common to all computer architectures, and an
 architecture-specific short-range solver.
 Modular code design combined with particle caching allows the short-range
 solvers to be `hot-swappable' on-node; they are blind to the parallel implement
ation of the long-range solver.
 The short-range solvers can use direct particle-particle interactions,

HACC Time Stepping Scheme
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already discussed, an important feature of the work presented here is
 the ability to carry out error-controlled approximate simulations at high
 throughput.
 In order to understand how to implement this, we provide some details on
 the HACC time-stepping algorithm.
 In HACC, time evolution is viewed as a symplectic map on phase space: 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(t)=\exp(-t{\bf {H}})\zeta(0)$
\end_inset

 where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 is a phase-space vector 
\begin_inset Formula $({\bf x},{\bf v})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the (self-consistent) Hamiltonian, and the operator, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf {H}}=[H,~]_{P}$
\end_inset

, denotes the action of taking the Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian.
 Suppose that the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of two parts; then
 by using the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff (CBH) series we can build an integrator
 for the time evolution; repeated application of the CBH formula yields
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\exp[-t({\bf {H}}_{1}+{\bf {H}}_{2})]=\exp[-(t/2){\bf {H}}_{1}]\exp(-t{\bf {H}}_{2})\exp[-(t/2){\bf {H}}_{1}]+O(t^{3}),
\]

\end_inset

a second order symplectic integrator.
 In the basic PM application, the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the free particle (kinetic) piece while 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the one-particle effective potential; corresponding respectively to
 the `stream' and `kick' maps 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}=\exp(-t{\bf {H}}_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}=\exp(-t{\bf {H}}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 In the stream map, the particle position is drifted using its known velocity,
 which remains unchanged; in the kick map, the velocity is updated using
 the force evaluation, while the position remains unchanged.
 This symmetric `split-operator' step is termed SKS (stream-kick-stream).
 A KSK scheme constitutes an alternative second-order symplectic integrator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the presence of both short and long-range forces, we split the Hamiltonian
 into two parts, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{1}=H_{sr}+H_{lr}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{sr}$
\end_inset

 contains the kinetic and particle-particle force interaction (with an associate
d map 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{sr}$
\end_inset

), whereas, 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}=H_{lr}$
\end_inset

 is just the long range force, corresponding to the map 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{lr}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the long range force varies relatively slowly, we construct a single
 time-step map by sub-cycling 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{sr}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{full}(t)=M_{lr}(t/2)[M_{sr}(t/n_{c})]^{n_{c}}M_{lr}(t/2)$
\end_inset

, the total map being a usual second-order symplectic integrator.
 This corresponds to a KSK step, where the S is not an exact stream step,
 but has enough 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{sr}$
\end_inset

 steps composed together to obtain the required accuracy.
 (We take care that the time-dependence in the self-consistent potential
 is treated correctly; HACC uses the scale factor, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, as the time variable.) The code therefore has two degrees of freedom to
 tune its time-steps: the length of the full time step (
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 above), and the number of sub-cycles for the short range force (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{c}$
\end_inset

 above).
 As discussed later below, we will use the flexibility in the sub-cycling
 as a way of reducing the number of time steps such that the loss of accuracy
 only affects the resolution at very small scales, which, as discussed previousl
y, are not of interest in the current set of simulations.
 For high-resolution applications, HACC allows for particle-level adaptive
 time-stepping, but that feature is not exploited here.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we systematically examine how reducing the number of global
 time steps affects individual gross halo properties (i.e., halo masses, positions
, and velocities), as well as aggregate statistics such as the halo mass
 function and spatial clustering.
 We run a set of convergence tests with boxes of size 
\begin_inset Formula $(256h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $256^{3}$
\end_inset

 particles.
 These runs have a similar particle mass as the full 
\begin_inset Formula $(4000h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 volume simulations we present later.
 We run these with the following time step options : 450/5, 300/3, 300/2,
 150/3 and 150/2 where the first number is the number of long time-steps,
 while the second is the number of subcycles.
 The 450/5 case has been independently verified to give fully converged
 results and is the baseline against which we compare all other results.
 Each simulation is started from the same initial condition and evolved
 down to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

.
 We demonstrate that the 300/2 case, corresponding to a time step of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta a\approx0.003$
\end_inset

 reproduces the full resolution simulation for all the large scale properties
 we consider, and is our choice for the mock catalogs presented in Section

\begin_layout Subsection
Halo Matching Algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compare detailed halo properties, we need to match individual
 halos between our reference 450/5 run and test runs with reduced time steps.
 All simulations share the same particle initial conditions, allowing us
 to match halos in different runs by matching their individual particle
 content.
 Given a halo in simulation A, we consider all halos in simulation B that
 between them hold all the particles belonging to the halo in simulation
 A.
 Given this list of possible matches, we choose the halo in run B with the
 largest number of common particles with the reference halo in run A.
 To avoid spurious matches, we also require that the fraction of common
 particles (relative to simulation A) exceeds a given threshold.
 To illustrate how this matching algorithm works, we use the samples from
 the 300/2 simulation and the 450/5 simulation, and adopt a threshold of
 50% as our default choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matching algorithm described above is unidirectional -- multiple halos
 in run A may have particles resident in a single halo in run B.
 In our simulations, this happens at the 1-2% level, adopting a particle
 matching threshold of 50%.
 We refer to these cases as `multiply-booked' halos.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 compares halo masses when matching the 450/5 simulation to the 300/2 simulation
 for the case of multiply-booked halos, as well as the rest.
 The top left panel shows the mass scatter for all the matched halos between
 the two simulations, while the top right panel shows the mass scatter only
 for the halos that have one-to-one correspondence.
 The bottom left panel shows the mass scatter for individual multiply-booked
 halos, while the bottom right panel plots the summed halo mass for the
 corresponding halos.
 The overall behavior represented in Figure

Comparing the halo mass of matched halos in the 450/5 simulation (x-axis)
 to the 300/2 simulation (y-axis) at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

.
 Panels correspond to halos with different matching criteria imposed: all
 the matched halos (top left), the vast majority of matched halos having
 one-to-one correspondence (top right), matched halos not having one-to-one
 correspondence called

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 halos (bottom left), and the multiply-booked halos whose corresponding
 halo masses are added (bottom right).
 The color bar on the right indicates the corresponding color to the number
 of halos in the plot.
 The results shown in these panels imply that the low-mass scatter between
 the 450/5 simulation and the 300/2 simulation shown in the top left panel
 arises when physically associated halos in the 450/5 simulation are merged
 into one halo in the 300/2 simulation due to an effectively worse resolution
 in the latter case.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the top left panel shows, there are low-mass halos in the 450/5 simulation
 matched to high-mass halos in the 300/2 simulation.
 The same trend is observed for the case of multiply-booked halos (bottom
 left panel), but not for the one-to-one matched halos (top right).
 Furthermore, the disagreement for halo masses between the two simulations
 are resolved by adding the corresponding halo masses.
 This implies that there are multiple halos in the 450/5 simulation which
 are merged into one halo in the 300/2 simulation.
 The smaller number of time steps in the 300/2 simulations reduces substructure
 as well as the compactness of the halos compared to the 450/5 simulation.
 Thus, for a small fraction of halos in the 450/5 simulation, individual
 halos can be merged into a single halo in the 300/2 simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the number densities of the unmatched halos in the 450/5 simulation
 when compared to the 300/2 simulation at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

.
 There are three reasons that halos can turn up as unmatched.
 In the first case, particles forming a halo in simulation A may not form
 a component of a halo in simulation B (no common particles).
 Second, if the fraction of common particles over the total number of particles
 in each halo is less than the threshold of 50%, these halos will be eliminated
 from the matching set.
 Finally, for the case of multiply-booked halos, we remove all but the one
 with the largest number of common particles.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mass-content"

\end_inset

, we show each type of unmatched number density as a function of halo mass.
 The first case occurs only for low mass halos, where low effective resolution
 in a simulation can lead to halo drop out (halos are too

fuzzy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to meet the Friends-of-Friends (FOF) connectivity criterion), and falls
 off steeply with rising halo mass.
 Most of the unmatched halos arise because they do not pass the threshold
 criterion.
 The fraction of unmatched halos due to being

The trends described above persist at different redshifts.
 As we reduce the number of total long timesteps taken, the unmatched fraction
 increases, due to the lower resolution of the simulations, while the number
 of sub-cycles does not noticeably change these results.
 In Section

Halo Properties

\begin_layout Standard
We now systematically compare halo properties (i.e., halo mass, position,
 and velocity) for halos in the lower resolution runs that were successfully
 matched to those in the 450/5 simulation.
 We are interested in correctly describing the large-scale distribution
 of galaxies using an HOD approach; this requires that only the dark matter
 halo locations and masses be estimated with sufficient accuracy.

ly lower FOF masses than the 450/5 simulation.
 (The same linking length (

 the case of the 300/2 simulation, the deviation from the FOF masses in
 the 450/5 simulation is about 1.7%, while for the case of the 150/3 and
 150/2 simulations, the deviations are about 5.7% and 8.5% respectively.
 The FOF masses are highest in the 450/5 simulation, decreasing systematically
 with increase in loss of temporal resolution.

 Simulations with a smaller number of global time steps (150) display significan

 With 300 global time steps, the results are much improved; the velocity
 bias is almost entirely removed and the scatter is significantly reduced.
 The standard deviation in the differences in halo distances is matched

 As a reference, the standard deviation of velocities for the full resolution

 In the following, we describe how to implement a systematic mass correction
 by matching to the 450/5 results; we also display the resulting observables
 including mass functions and power spectra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To undertake the mass calibration, we first take all the matched halos between
 the 450/5 simulation and the de-tuned simulations and compute means for
 each mass bin.
 We consider only the matched halos because the aim of the mass adjustment
 is to correct systematic mass differences for the halos that are identical
 in the different runs.
 After computing the means for each mass bin, we fit them to a functional
 form that brings the reassigned halo mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{re}$
\end_inset

, close to the average halo mass for the 450/5 simulation.
 For our simulations, we find that the following simple form suffices for
 this task:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{re}=M[1.0+\alpha(M/10^{12.0}[h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}])^{\beta}],}\label{eq:mass_adjust}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{re}$
\end_inset

 is the reassigned halo mass, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the original halo mass, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 are free parameters.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 values for the simulations with different numbers of time steps are listed

 The best-fit parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

Given the mass corrections, we now compute mass functions and halo power
 spectra using the results from the different time-stepping schemes.
 Note that here we apply the mass adjustment to all the halos in the simulations
 and use them to compute the mass functions and power spectra.

 is the cumulative mass function for the 450/5 simulation and 
\begin_inset Formula $n(>M)$
\end_inset

 is the cumulative mass function for the other cases.
 We compare the results before and after mass adjustment.
 While the mass functions from the 150/3 and 150/2 simulations are suppressed
 by more than 10% on all mass ranges before correction, they are significantly
 improved afterwards, especially for halo masses greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13.0}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
 For simulations with 300 global time steps, the mass adjustment is especially
 effective at small halo masses.

 Lines, from top to bottom, correspond to the time stepping choices, 300/3

Next we compute the halo-matter cross power spectra between halo and matter
 density fields in both real and redshift space, as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:crossMater_step"

\end_inset

.
 This figure shows the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm}/P_{hm,450/5}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm,450/5}$
\end_inset

 is the cross power spectrum for the 450/5 simulation and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm}$
\end_inset

 is the cross power spectrum for other time steps.
 For the dark matter density field, we use the output of the 450/5 simulation
 for all the halo samples.
 Note that the dark matter density fields are given in real space for both
 cases.
 In this way, the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{hm}/P_{hm,450/5}$
\end_inset

 in real space is equivalent to the ratio of halo bias between the 450/5
 simulation and the simulations with other time-steps.
 To select halos, we apply the soft mass cut method using the probability
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle N_{halo}(M)\rangle=\frac{1}{2}{\rm erfc}\left(\frac{{\rm log_{10}(M_{cut}/}M)}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we set 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm M_{cut}=10^{13.0}{\it h}^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 This probability has a similar form to the HOD technique so that the probabilit
y gradually becomes one as halo mass increases.
 We use this method to avoid noise from halos scattering across sharp halo
 mass boundaries.
 The errors calculated here are not due to sample variance as we generate
 10 samples from one full sample with the soft mass cut method.
 The results show that as the time stepping is coarsened, the ratio of the
 cross power spectra increases, especially in redshift space, where we observe
 large deviations from unity on small scales for the 150/2 and 150/3 simulations.
 This is due to the overall smaller halo velocities for those simulations,
 as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:HaloProperty_step"

\end_inset

.
 For the simulations with the 300 global time steps, overall agreement with
 the 450/5 simulation is almost at the 1% level on any scale in both real
 space and redshift-space.
 Based on these convergence tests, we conclude that the 300/2 option meets
 the error requirements.

Constructing Light Cones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:light cones"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can choose to construct mock catalogs either from a single static snapshot
 in redshift or to take the light cone evolution of the halo and galaxy
 distribution into account.
 There are two broad approaches to the latter problem.
 The first is to incrementally build up the light cone while the simulation
 is running, while the second stitches static snapshots together at different
 redshifts to construct an approximate light cone.
 Both methods have advantages and disadvantages.
 Building the light cone 
\begin_inset Quotes grd
\end_inset

on the fly” leads to the correct redshift evolution by construction, but
 requires simulation post-processing codes (like halo finders) to be run
 concurrently with the simulation, making it nontrivial to change input
 parameters to these analyses.
 Using static time snapshots can be more flexible, but requires a relatively
 dense sampling of timesteps.
 We take this latter approach here; this section describes how we interpolate
 between different snapshots and the requirements on the time step sampling.
 We note that these results are more broadly applicable than just for the
 simulation suite considered here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our algorithm for constructing a light cone is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For every snapshot, construct a spherical shell (or part thereof) with a
 radius centered on the comoving distance to the snapshot redshift and a
 width equal to its redshift extent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The redshifts of each halo are determined by their radial distance from
 the origin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Interpolate the position and velocity (see below) of the halo from the snapshot
 redshift to the halo redshift.
 Note that changing the position of the halo strictly changes its redshift,
 but this is a small effect (mostly 
\begin_inset Formula $<0.1\%$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the case of a halo crossing its shell boundary, we choose the halo whose
 distance from the boundary is closer before shifting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We interpolate the positions of halos using a simple linear rule: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{x}|_{z=z_{pos}}=\vec{x}|_{z=z_{snap}}+\vec{v}_{pec}|_{z=z_{snap}}\Delta t,\label{eq:light cone}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{snap}$
\end_inset

 is the redshift of the snapshot, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{pos}$
\end_inset

 is the redshift corresponding to the halo's radial position, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{pec}$
\end_inset

 is its peculiar velocity, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is the time elapsed between 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{snap}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{pos}$
\end_inset

.
 We test this using the calibration simulations discussed in the previous
 section, restricting ourselves to halos identified across two or more timesteps.
 The left panel of Figure

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 simulations, both before and after shifting halos from 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.25$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.15$
\end_inset

 using the above equation.
 The improvement is clearly visible; the scatter after shifting the halos
 reduces to half of the original scatter with similar results for the other
 components and different redshift slices.
 The right panel of the same figure shows the ratio of the power spectrum
 of the shifted halos to its expected value.
 We consider shifts in redshift ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.05$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.25$
\end_inset

.
 Except for the

 case at high 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 out to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
\end_inset

; the accuracy is a few tenths of a percent for most cases over most of
 that range.
 We obtain similar results for shifting to different redshifts.

 The right panel of the same figure shows the ratio of the predicted angle-avera

 While the accuracy is degraded compared to the real space case, we still

 The fall-off at large

 in the positions of the galaxies, washing out the signal on small scales.

After assigning a number of galaxies to each halo, we distribute those galaxies
 within the halo.
 The central galaxy is always at the center of the halo, while the distribution
 of satellite galaxies follows a spherically symmetric NFW profile specified
 by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho(r)=\frac{4\rho_{s}}{\frac{cr}{R_{{\rm vir}}}(1+\frac{cr}{R_{{\rm vir}}})^{2}},

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $r_{s}=R_{{\rm vir}}/c$

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 is the virial radius for the halo and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

 is the concentration parameter.
 We use the emulator described in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 to generate a table of concentration-mass relations for halos at each redshift.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We set the velocity of the central galaxy to be equal to the host halo velocity.
 We assume that satellite galaxies are randomly moving inside the host halos.
 Therefore, the velocities of the satellite galaxies are the sum of their
 host halo velocity and a random virial component.
 For this random component, we draw from a Gaussian distribution with zero
 mean and variance given by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle v_{x}^{2}\rangle=\langle v_{y}^{2}\rangle=\langle v_{z}^{2}\rangle=\frac{1}{3}\frac{GM}{R_{{\rm vir}}}.\label{eq:variance}

After matching the redshift distribution of galaxies, we finally compute

 In Figure

, we compare these correlation functions to the one from DR11.
 The left panel shows the monopole terms of the correlation functions, and
 the right panel, the quadrupole terms.
 We do not observe significant differences between the galaxy mock catalogs
 from the simulation at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.55$
\end_inset

 and the light cone sample for both monopole and quadrupole terms.
 For the monopole terms, the mock catalogs agree relatively well with the
 one from DR11 on 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[40h^{-1}{\rm Mpc},80h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}]$
\end_inset

.
 Note that we do not try to fit to the acoustic peak here, because the cosmologi
es for our simulation and DR11 are different.
 Our prediction for the quadrupole term differs from the observed quadrupole
 term from DR11 due to an overestimate in the power, which is also seen
 in Ref.

As a second application for our simulation suite, we explore how the baryon

 These shifts, predicted by basic perturbative arguments (see, e.g., Refs.

), must be calibrated at the sub-percent level for future BAO experiments
 as a function of the underlying cosmology and galaxy type.
 Measuring these shifts requires large simulation volumes to robustly distinguis
h them from statistical errors.
 The approximations we describe in this paper allow such large volumes to
 be run, without sacrificing the gross details (positions, masses, velocities)
 of the halos themselves (which, in turn, enables us to construct mock galaxy
 populations).
 Note that our goal here is to demonstrate the statistical power of these
 simulations.
\end_layout

In order to construct samples of different galaxy biases, we construct realizati

 The resulting nine HODs span a range of biases from 1.5 to 3.5.
 In order to estimate the covariance matrix for galaxy correlation functions,
 we subdivide each of our

\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{{\rm fit}}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\xi_{{\rm fit}}(r)=B\xi_{t}(\alpha r)+A_{0}+A_{1}/r+A_{2}/r^{2},\label{eq:model1}

\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{t}$

 is the galaxy bias squared and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0,1,2}$
\end_inset

 represent nuisance parameters to account for shot noise, nonlinear evolution
 of the matter density field and the mapping from matter to galaxies.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 measures the shift in the BAO scale relative to what is assumed for the
 template function, and is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha\equiv\left(\frac{D_{{\rm V}}(z)}{r_{{\rm d}}}\right)\left(\frac{r_{{\rm d,fid}}}{D_{{\rm V}}^{{\rm fid}}(z)}\right),\label{eq:alpha_ratio}

\begin_inset Formula $D_{{\rm A}}$

 We set 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=5h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$

 We determine the parameters by minimizing 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}=(\xi_{{\rm HOD}}-\xi_{{\rm fit}})^{{\rm T}}C^{-1}(\xi_{{\rm HOD}}-\xi_{{\rm fit}})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $C^{-1}$

\end_inset

 in bins of 
\begin_inset Formula $4h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 for a total of 25 data points.
 Since all parameters except 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are linear, we perform the minimization on a grid of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 values, computing the minimum value of the other parameters directly.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 measures the shift of the BAO peak from its original position predicted
 by linear perturbation theory.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$

The precision measurements expected from current and future galaxy spectroscopic
 surveys to test the expansion and structure formation history of the Universe
 require an accurate understanding of systematic effects.
 To explore these effects, large-volume N-body simulations with acceptable
 accuracy are required.
 De-tuning high-resolution N-body codes by coarse-graining the time stepping
 offers a way to generate these simulations at lower computational cost.
 In this paper we have presented a quantitative study of the impact of time
 step sizes on the halo and matter density fields using the HACC code.
 HACC has two adjustable time stepping parameters -- a global time step
 and sub-cycle steps to track particle trajectories on small scales.
 We consider cases where we increase the length of each time step by factors
 of 1.5 and 3 respectively, as well as reducing the number of sub-cycles.
 We find that the number of sub-cycles makes almost no difference to any
 of our final results.
\end_layout

Our fiducial choice is to use 300 global time steps corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta a(z)=0.003$
\end_inset

 and 2 sub-cycles (increasing the length of the global time step by a factor
 of 1.5 and that of the sub-cycles by a factor of 2.5), resulting in a reduction
 of the simulation run times by a factor of four.
 We keep the mass resolution constant; the results here are based on a particle
 mass of 
\begin_inset Formula $6.86\times10^{10}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
 We summarize the key results below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(a) Halo masses are underestimated because reducing the number of time steps
 produces halos with less substructure and a more diffuse distribution of
 mass.
 We demonstrate that this can be corrected with higher fidelity simulations,
 recovering the halo masses to 98% fidelity.
 The halo mass function is correctly recovered for masses above 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{12.7}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 100 particles per halo.
 We run the halo finder with identical parameters as in the full resolution
 runs for simplicity.
 It may however be possible to get further improvements by changing the
 parameters of the halo finder, as was done in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We leave an exploration of this for future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(b) The halo positions and velocities are recovered with a scatter of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.08h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $12.8{\rm km/s}$
\end_inset

 respectively, ensuring that their large scale distributions are unaffected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(c) The clustering of halos is correctly recovered to better than 1% on
 scales below 
\begin_inset Formula $k<1h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

 in real space and 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.5h{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$
\end_inset

 in redshift space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also consider the frequency with which one must store outputs to construct
 galaxy light cones.
 In real space, a simple linear interpolation over 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z<0.25$
\end_inset

 recovers the power spectrum to better than 1% for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<1h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 In redshift space, we find we additionally need to interpolate halo velocities.
 Again, linear interpolation recovers the redshift space power spectrum
 to 1% for 
\begin_inset Formula $k<0.8h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 We conclude that spacings of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta z=0.05$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

 are adequate for constructing light cones from single-time snapshots.
 We note that these requirements are significantly less stringent than what
 is required for constructing merger trees, and therefore will often be
 trivially met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a demonstration of the utility of the methods presented here, we generate
 a suite of five 
\begin_inset Formula $(4h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^{3}$
\end_inset

 simulations for a total simulation volume of 320 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{-3}{\rm Gpc}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 We consider two example applications of these.
 The first is the construction of mock galaxy catalogs.
 We focus here on the BOSS CMASS sample, but these simulations may be used
 for future surveys like eBOSS and DESI.
 The second demonstration is to measure the effects of nonlinear evolution
 and galaxy bias on the position of the BAO feature.
 This extends the work of Ref.
\begin_inset space ~

 with significantly improved statistics.
 We measure a high significance detection (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim6\sigma$
\end_inset

) of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.6\%$
\end_inset

 shift in the BAO peak, as well as detecting hints of a dependence on bias
 (for very large values of the bias).
 Both of these examples were chosen to demonstrate the utility of these
 simulations, and will be explored in more detail in future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above examples are not the only applications of the simulations made
 possible by our approach here.
 For instance, while the volumes of simulations are still not large enough
 to simply measure a sample covariance matrix, such simulations could be
 very useful in calibrating models of covariance matrices.
 Unlike other approximate methods, these simulations are accurate down to
 relatively small scales 
\begin_inset Formula $k\sim1h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and so are ideal for comparing against models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Large scale suites of simulations are an essential part of current and future
 cosmological analyses.
 This paper helps lay part of the groundwork for how one can optimize the
 computational requirements of such simulations.

The halo mass and velocity functions start to show incompleteness at 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{10.4}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim200$
\end_inset

 particles) for the Bolshoi simulation.
 Below those masses, the halo mass distributions show unphysical drop-offs
 indicating incomplete mass resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the standard classification of halos into host halos (not
 within the virial radius of a more massive halo) and subhalos (within the
 virial radius of a more massive halo), we further classify host halos into
 ejected and non-ejected halos.
 Ejected halos, also referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

backsplash
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 halos, are host halos whose main progenitor was classified, at some point
 in its merger tree history, as a subhalo.
 As we discuss below, these ejected halos have very different clustering
 properties compared to their non-ejected counterparts.
 The ejected fraction for the Bolshoi simulation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim15.8\%$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{11}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

, and drops to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim6.3\%$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$
\end_inset

.
 The lower mass resolution of the MultiDark simulation prevents us from
 making this additional sub-classification.
 Accordingly, results that rely on this split are restricted to the Bolshoi
 simulation and mass range.
