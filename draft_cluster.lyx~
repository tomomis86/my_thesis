Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

CDM, large collapsed halos are 
\color black
replete
\color inherit
 with subhalos.
 Subhalos are distributed radially within their parent halos 
\color black
driven by several
\color inherit
 important dynamical processes.
 Segregation of subhalos is a phenomenon where subhalos with particular
 properties (such as mass at accretion) exhibit different radial profiles
 in their host halos.
 For example, subhalos with larger maximum circular velocity (i.e., having
 deeper potentials) tend to be closer to the center of their host halos
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wu_etal2013"

\end_inset

, while some studies found that more massive subhalos are internally less
 centrally concentrated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "angulo_09,contini_11,de_lucia_04,reed05"

\end_inset

.
 In terms of dynamical friction, more massive subhalos (or the ones with
 larger maximum circular velocities) are expected to be closer to the center;
 however, they experience more tidal mass loss due to stronger tidal fields.
 It is hard to decouple those two competing effects, and this is why several
 studies find opposite trends in the radial distributions of subhalos.
 There are several studies showing that subhalos selected based on their
 masses at accretion and masses at the present time show different radial
 distributions: Subhalos selected by their masses at accretion show more
 centrally concentrated radial profiles than the ones selected by their
 present-day masses (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nagai05"

\end_inset

).
 Characterizing segregation is sensitive to the selection of the subhalos
 and their chosen properties.
 Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vdBosch16"

\end_inset

 investigated the segregation of dark matter subhalos in great detail using
 Spearman rank-order correlations to quantitatively evaluate the correlation
 between 12 different subhalo properties and segregation indicators (such
 as orbital energy and halo-centric radius).
 Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vdBosch16"

\end_inset

 found that accretion redshifts, which are the redshifts at which the subhalos
 are accreted by their host halos, is one of the key properties that determines
 segregation.
 Subhalos accreted earlier tend to have more centrally concentrated radial
 distributions than the ones accreted later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is crucial to understand how a particular selection criterion for subhalos
 determines how they cluster differently on small scales.
 This is due to the fact that different radial profiles change 1-halo terms
 in correlation functions as well as 
\color black
small-scale redshift-space distortions.
 Those can possibly cause systematic errors/biases on large-scale measurements
\color inherit
 [
\color red
zentner,hearin_15
\color inherit
].
 In this chapter, we first investigate how the radial segregation of subhalos
 depends on their host halo masses.
 Then, we compute the observational signature of this effect using two-point
 correlation functions.
 Understanding segregation of the subhalos and comparing that to segregation
 of galaxies will provide the clues for the connection between halos and
 galaxies.
 These are of the main open questions in cosmology--how galaxies populate
 dark matter halos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assembly history of host halos is essential to understanding the clustering.
 This dependence is known as an assembly bias, which is a phenomenon that
 the clustering of halos exhibits a dependence on additional properties
 beyond just their mass 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gao_etal05,wechsler06,gao_white07,li_etal08,hahn_etal09"

\end_inset

.
 In terms of the peak-background split formalism (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sheth_tormen99"

\end_inset

), the peaks of the same height in the initial density fluctuation collapse
 into halos of the same mass; however those peaks can be located in different
 environments (i.e., some peaks are in over-dense regions while others are
 in under-dense regions) and therefore have different assembly histories
 and therefore clustering 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dalal_etal08"

\end_inset

.
 These environmental differences result in the differences in the structural
 properties and internal structure of halos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bullock01,wechsler02,hahn_etal07b,faltenbacher_white10"

\end_inset

.
 We revisit the manifestation of assembly history on the internal structure
 of the host halos regarding segregation.
 In particular, we explore whether segregation of the subhalos in their
 radial distributions shows some dependence on internal properties of host
 halos such as concentration, which are strongly correlated with their assembly
 history.

 Below those masses, the halo mass distributions showed unphysical drop-offs
 indicating incomplete mass resolution.
 Therefore, we only select subhalos whose masses at accretion are greater
 than

\begin_layout Subsection
Mass Dependence of Segregation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate the mass dependence of segregation by comparing
 the radial distribution of subhalos as a function of host halo mass.
 We select host halos in three mass bins: 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, and masses greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, for each sample, we split their corresponding subhalos based on their
 redshift of accretion 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $<0.1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1-0.25$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25-0.5$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.5$
\end_inset

.
 We chose 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 to further split samples, because the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.1$
\end_inset

 reach their first peri-center passage at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

, while subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.25$
\end_inset

 have moved to their first apo-centric passage as noted in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vdBosch16"

\end_inset

 (see Fig.7).
 We also split samples at 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.5$
\end_inset

, because the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.5$
\end_inset

 will have completed their first 
\color black
full orbit
\color inherit
 and will have moved back towards the center.
 So, the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

 are the ones which will have orbited inside their host halos several times.
 Using these subsamples, we compute the radial distances in units of their
 virial radius.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:radial_massDependence"

\end_inset

 shows present radial profiles of subhalos as a function of the accretion
 redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 The solid lines are for subhalos in the host halos whose masses are greater
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, while circles and dashed lines correspond to the host halos whose masses
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}-10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}-10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 For the samples with the same accretion redshifts 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

, the radial profiles of the subhalos with different host halo masses do
 not exhibit any significant differences, which implies that segregation
 of subhalos is largely independent of host halo mass.
 Radial profiles with different accretion redshifts 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 tell us how subhalos move inside their host halos after accretion; most
 subhalos accreted after 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.1$
\end_inset

 are still close to the virial radius of their host halos, while the ones
 accreted around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.1-0.25$
\end_inset

 have moved towards center.
 After going through their first peri-center passage, the subhalos have
 moved back towards their apo-centers, and this is why the subhalos accreted
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.1-0.25$
\end_inset

 show more centrally concentrated radial profiles than the ones accreted
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.25-0.5$
\end_inset

.
 The subhalos which are accreted earlier (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

) are closer to the center due to the inside-out assembly of dark matter
 halos (i.e., the virial radius of their host halos were smaller when those
 subhalos were accreted).
 This result is consistent with that reported in Ref.

We further explore how subhalos move after accretion by computing their
 average halo-centric radius as a function of the accretion redshift as
 shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 We first rank-order the subhalos based on their accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and split them into 30 equal number bins.
 Then, we compute the average halo-centric radius for each bin.
 Fig.

 clearly tracks the radial motion of subhalos and does not show any mass-depende
nt feature for the subhalos with

\end_inset

.
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

, their average halo-centric radius shows little indication of an orbit.
 This is probably due to major mergers and violent relaxation afterwards.
 Ref.

 predicted the halo-centric radius based on the adiabatic model; however,
 the prediction gave a smaller halo-centric radius for more massive host
 halos, while Fig.

Note that the accretion redshift we use is the redshift that the subhalo
 is accreted most recently, but not all the subhalos stay inside of their
 host halos after accretion.
 There are some subhalos which move out from their host halos.
 Those halos are referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ejected halos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and including this transient population alters the clustering on small
 scales (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 Even though these ejected halos lie outside of the virial radius, they
 are likely to be gravitationally bound and accreted again.
 Some of the subhalos in the samples follow this sequence.
 So, we use the first accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

, which is the redshift that the subhalo is accreted for the first time,
 and repeat the same analysis done for Fig.

 and Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Here, we use the subhalos whose host halo masses are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$

 halo masses.

\end_inset

 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.4$
\end_inset

, we preferentially select subhalos which are more tightly bound to their
 host halos (because they never move out after accretion) and this is why
 the average radius is smaller for the case of

In this section, we investigate the correlation between the accretion redshift

\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$

\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}$

 are the subhalo mass/maximum circular velocity at the present time (in

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

 are the subhalo mass/maximum circular velocity at accretion.
 The retained mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 measures the mass loss after subhalos are accreted by their host halos,
 and it is tightly correlated with the accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 due to tidal stripping.
 As a general trend, subhalos which are accreted earlier experience more
 mass loss because they stay in their host halos and, are subjected to dynamical
 processes for longer.
 The question is how well this property 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 correlates with the accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 The retained masses of the subhalos 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 are tightly correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is expected, because the subhalos which are accreted earlier would
 be more stripped due to tidal effects and the amount of mass the subhalos
 lost and the time that the subhalos stay in their host halos should be
 correlated.
 Quantitatively, the cross correlation coefficient for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 is 0.651.
 We also check the correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

.
 As a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

, the change in halo mass is larger than the change in maximum circular
 velocity.
 However, this is because the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}\propto M_{{\rm vir}}^{1/3}$
\end_inset

 holds.
 Applying this scaling relation and converting 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

In this section, we investigate how segregation in the radial profiles appears
 observationally using two-point correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi(r)$
\end_inset

.
 
\color black
In real-space, we expect to see segregation of subhalos on the correlation
 functions similar to the radial profiles.
 The clustering of the subhalos accreted earlier has a larger amplitude
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $r<1h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, which is about the size of the virial radius of the cluster-sized halos
 (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}>10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{{\rm \odot}}}$
\end_inset

).
 However, the distance between a pair of the subhalos, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, is not normalized by the virial radius.
 So, we also expect the clustering of the subhalos on small scales depends
 on their host halo masses.
 In redshift-space, random motions of the subhalos within their host halos
 change the amplitude of the correlation functions.
 For the cluster-sized halos, a 1-halo term can be extended to 
\begin_inset Formula $10-15h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 due to large velocity dispersions and it is not clear how well we can see
 segregation of the subhalos on the redshift-space correlation functions.

/Galileon modified gravity and General Relativity.
 Often modified gravity models provide larger velocity dispersions, which
 generates different scale-dependence on the redshift-space correlation
 functions on small scales.
 So, it is important to understand how particular selections of galaxies/subhalo
s alters the small-scale clustering in redshift-space, as this can be a
 potential source of systematic error in measurements.

\begin_layout Standard
We first select host halos whose masses are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, and then look at the subsample the subhalos based on 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 Unlike the radial profiles, we do not normalize the distances between the
 subhalos and the corresponding host halos by the virial radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 to compute correlation functions.
 So, using host halos with different mass ranges will change the clustering
 signals on small scales, but the generic trend of segregation remains the
 same.
 In all that follows, we will use 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{sub,sub}$
\end_inset

 to denote the auto-correlation of the subhalos and their host halos, and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{mm}$
\end_inset

 for the matter auto-correlation.
 
\end_layout

We first compute the correlation functions in real-space to see how well
 we can see the segregation on correlation functions without normalizing

 The coordinates in redshift-space are defined as

 The peculiar velocity along the line-of-sight direction generates anisotropy

 the correlation functions.
 Using the angle between a subhalo pair and the line-of-sight direction

, we compute the 2D correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{s}(s,\mu)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\equiv cos\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we project the 2D correlation functions onto Legendre polynomials
 to compute monopole and quadrupole terms such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi_{s}^{(0)}(s)=(int)d\mu\xi_{s}(s,\mu)L_{0}(\mu),

and

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 are the zeroth-order and second-order Legendre polynomials.
 The left panel of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows the monopole term of the subhalo auto-correlation functions, while
 the right panel shows the quadrupole terms.
 For the monopole terms, the segregation signal is completely smeared out
 and the correlation functions for each sample is almost indistinguishable;
 however, the quadrupole term shows different scale-dependence for each
 sample more clearly.
 This implies that these two subsamples of subhalos have different velocity
 dispersions on small scales (i.e., different Finger-of-God effect).
 To take a closer look at this, we first plot the correlation functions

 as shown in Fig.

 The figure shows that the subhalos with

 have larger internal velocities than the ones with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.25$
\end_inset

 Quantitatively, the median value for the subhalos with

\end_inset

 is about 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$

km/s, while it is about 
\begin_inset Formula $700$
\end_inset

km/s for the ones with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.25$
\end_inset

 This is likely because subhalos accreted earlier have lost much of their
 kinetic energy due to dynamical friction.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hist_vel"

\end_inset

 is consistent with Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:xi_mu"

\end_inset

 in the sense that small internal velocities for subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

 will make the amplitude of the redshift-space correlation functions at
 the inner regions larger, because the pair-distances for those subhalos
 will not be elongated as much as for the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to these comparions, we compute the velocity distribution of
 subhalos from the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD).
 We first populate the host halos with 100 test subhalos each.
 Then, we assume that these subhalos are randomly moving inside the host
 halos.
 For this random motion, we draw from a Gaussian distribution with zero
 mean and variance given by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\langle v_{x}^{2}\rangle=\langle v_{y}^{2}\rangle=\langle v_{z}^{2}\rangle=\frac{1}{3}\frac{GM_{{\rm vir}}}{R_{{\rm vir}}},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 are the virial mass and virial radius of the host halos and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{z}$
\end_inset

 are the velocities of the satellite galaxies in each direction with respect
 to the velocity of the host halos.
 In Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hist_vel"

\end_inset

, we see that the HOD-predicted velocity distribution agrees well with the
 velocity distribution of the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.25$
\end_inset

.
 We find that the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.25$
\end_inset

 follow the virialized velocity distribution.
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.25$
\end_inset

, their velocities will be under-estimated if the HOD model is used to compute
 their velocities.

Effects of Assembly Bias on Segregation

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate whether the assembly history of the host
 halos affects the subhalo mass functions and spatial distribution of the
 subhalos.
 We first select the host halos whose masses are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, but the same result still holds for different host halo masses
\color black
.
 Then, we split the sample based on their concentration.
 
\color inherit
We use the median concentration-mass relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}(M_{{\rm vir}})$
\end_inset

 shown in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
{\rm log}_{10}\bar{c}=-0.097{\rm log_{10}M_{vir}}+2.148.\label{eq:concen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For every halo in the Bolshoi catalogs, we use its tabulated 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}(M_{{\rm vir}}),$
\end_inset

 and then use the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$
\end_inset

 to compare with the measured concentration for every halo.
 We will henceforth refer to halos with 
\begin_inset Formula $c<\bar{c}(M_{{\rm vir}})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

low-concentration halos
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Again here, we now use concentrations as an indicator of assembly history:
 Ref.

 showed that early-forming halos tend to have higher concentration than
 late-forming halos.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The radial profiles of the subhalos do not exhibit any significant differences
 for different concentration of the host halos, which implies that segregation
 of subhalos is independent of assembly history.

Discussion/Future Work

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we investigated environmental effects on segregation of subhalos
 using the accretion redshift as a key parameter.
 We first studied whether the segregation of radial profiles show any dependence
 on the host halo mass.
 Then, we further explored whether the assembly history of host halos affects
 the radial distributions.
 In addition, we also computed two-point correlation functions for samples
 of subhalos (split by 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

) to examine expected observational signature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude this chapter with the following summary of our findings.

 Until subhalos complete their firs

), they track the radial motion of subhalos (see Fig.

reference "fig:halo_centric1"

\end_inset

).
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

, their average halo-centric radius is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 due to major mergers and violent relaxation.
 Since the segregation is independent of the host halo mass, we can measure/comp
are this to galaxy segregation for clusters as well as groups.
 The generic trend is consistent with the findings in Ref.

, choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$

 or

 makes practically no difference in the radial distributions, while the

 larger than the one using 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$

 In terms of galaxy formation, galaxy properties might be more correlated
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

, and comparing our finding to observations can be used to test which accretion
 redshift is more relevant to segregation on galaxy clustering.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 are correlated, we test how much segregation actually comes from 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 by generating samples

.
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

, subhalos which lose more mass are preferentially closer to the center,
 while there is no correlation between the amount of mass loss and the radial
 distribution for the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We found that assembly history of host halos does not affect the radial
 distribution of subhalos, and the distribution of the subhalos does not
 agree with the NFW profile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We found that the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

 have almost twice as large an amplitude for the redshift-space correlation
 functions at the most inner region compared to that for the subhalos with
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

 have almost 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

 larger internal velocity (i.e., the subhalo velocity with respect to the
 velocity of its host halo) than the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a possible direction for future work, we can compare segregation of radial
 profiles from simulations with observations using the age-matching technique,
 which connects the star formation rate of galaxies to the formation time
 of their dark matter halos (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 This will help us discern which galaxy property (such as color) might be
 correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, we can extend our analysis of assembly bias using other parameters
 such as spin (which might be a good indicator of recent mergers).

 We use the host halos whose masses are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

 and split them based on their concentrations.
 The blue lines are the subhalos whose host halos have high concentration,
 while the green lines are for low concentration.
 (Remake the figure without plotting the circles+ I should choose host halos
 with more mass range; also should I use MD instead of Bolshoi?)

 To compute the NFW profiles, we use the median concentration of each sample;
 4.767 for the low-concentration halos and 7.446 for the high-concentration
 halos.
 We see the similar trend on the outer region that the subhalos in the low-conce
ntration halos have higher amplitude than the ones for the high-concentration
 halos.
 Overall profiles between NFW profiles and subhalos are consistent with
 the finding in XXX [
