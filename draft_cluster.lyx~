Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Segregation of subhalos is a phenomenon where subhalos with particular propertie
s (such as mass at accretion) exhibit different radial profiles in their
 host halos.
 For example, subhalos with larger maximum circular velocity (i.e., having
 deeper potential depth) tend to be closer to the center of their host halos
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wu_etal2013"

\end_inset

, while some studies found that more massive subhalos are less centrally
 concentrated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "angulo_09,contini_11,de_lucia_04,reed05"

\end_inset

.
 In terms of dynamical friction, more massive subhalos (or the ones with
 larger maximum circular velocities) are expected to be closer to the center;
 however, they experience more tidal mass loss due to stronger tidal fields.
 It is hard to decouple those two competing effects, and this is why several
 studies find an opposite trend in the radial distributions.
 There are several studies showing that subhalos selected based on their
 masses at accretion and at present show different radial distributions;
 subhalos selected by their masses at accretion show more centrally concentrated
 radial profiles than the ones selected by their present-day masses (e.g.,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Characterizing segregation is sensitive to the selection of the subhalos
 and their chosen properties.
 Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vdBosch16"

\end_inset

 investigated the segregation of dark matter subhalos in great details using
 Spearman rank-order correlations to quantitatively evaluate the correlation
 between 12 different subhalo properties and segregation indicators (such
 as orbital energy and halo-centric radius).
 Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vdBosch16"

\end_inset

 found that accretion redshifts, which are the redshifts that subhalos are
 accreted by their host halos, is one of the major segregation property;
 subhalos accreted earlier tend to have more centrally concentrated radial
 distributions than the ones accreted later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is crucial to understand how a particular choice of subhalos cluster
 differently on small scales; different radial profiles will change 1-halo
 terms in correlation functions as well as 
\color black
small-scale redshift-space distortions.
 Those can possibly cause systematic errors/biases on large scale measurements
\color inherit
 [
\color red
zentner,hearin_15
\color inherit
].
 In this chapter, we first investigate whether segregation of subhalos on
 radial profiles depends on their host halo masses.
 Then, we compute its observational signature using two-point correlation
 functions.
 Understanding segregation of the subhalos and comparing that to segregation
 of galaxies will provide the clues for the connection between halos and
 galaxies.

\begin_layout Standard
The assembly history of host halos is essential to the clustering known
 as an assembly bias, which is a phenomenon that the clustering of halos
 exhibits a dependence on additional properties beyond their mass 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In terms of the peak-background split formalism (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sheth_tormen99"

\end_inset

), the peaks of the same height in the initial density fluctuation collapse
 into the halos of the same mass; those peaks can be in different environments
 (i.e., some peaks are in over-dense regions while the others are in under-dense
 regions) and therefore have different assembly histories and clustering
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dalal_etal08"

\end_inset

.
 This environmental differences results in the differences in the structural
 properties/internal structure of halos 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "bullock01,wechsler02,hahn_etal07b,faltenbacher_white10"

\end_inset

.
 We revisit the manifestation of assembly history on the internal structure
 of the host halos regarding to segregation.
 In particular, we explore whether segregation of the subhalos in their
 radial distributions shows some dependence on internal properties of host
 halos such as concentration, which has strong correlation with their assembly
 history.

 Below those masses, the halo mass distributions show unphysical drop-offs

\begin_layout Subsection
Mass Dependence of Segregation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate the mass dependence of segregation by comparing
 the radial distribution of subhalos with different host halo masses.
 We select host halos in three mass bins: 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, and greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, for each sample, we split their corresponding subhalos based on the
 accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $<0.1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1-0.25$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25-0.5$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $>0.5$
\end_inset

.
 We chose 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 to split samples, because the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.1$
\end_inset

 reach their first peri-center at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

, while subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.25$
\end_inset

 move to their first apo-centric passage according to Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "vdBosch16"

\end_inset

 (see Fig.7).
 We also split samples at 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.5$
\end_inset

, because the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}=0.5$
\end_inset

 complete their first 
\color red
orbiting
\color inherit
 and move back to the center.
 So, the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

 are the ones which orbit inside their host halos several times.
 Using those subsamples, we compute the radial distances normalized by their
 virial radius.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:radial_massDependence"

\end_inset

 shows present radial profiles of subhalos as a function of the accretion
 redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 The solid lines are for the subhalos in the host halos whose masses are
 greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, while circles and dashed lines correspond to the host halos whose masses
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}-10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}=10^{13}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}-10^{13.5}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 For the samples with the same accretion redshifts 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

, the radial profiles of the subhalos with different host halo masses do
 not exhibit any significant differences, which implies that segregation
 of subhalos is independent of host halo mass.
 Radial profiles with different accretion redshifts 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 tell us how subhalos move inside their host halos after accretion; most
 of subhalos accreted after 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.1$
\end_inset

 are still close to the virial radius of their host halos, while the ones
 accreted around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.1-0.25$
\end_inset

 move towards center.
 After going through their first peri-center, the subhalos move back to
 their apo-centric passage, and this is why the subhalos accreted around
 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.1-0.25$
\end_inset

 show more centrally concentrated radial profiles than the ones accreted
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.25-0.5$
\end_inset

.
 The subhalos which are accreted earlier (i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

) are closer to the center due to the inside-out assembly of dark matter
 halos (i.e., the virial radius of their host halos were smaller when those
 subhalos were accreted).
 This result is consistent with Ref.

We further explore how subhalos move after accretion by computing the average
 halo-centric radius as a function of the accretion redshift as shown in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 We first rank-order the subhalos based on their accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and split them in 30 equal number bins.
 Then, we compute the average halo-centric radius for each bin.

nt feature for the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

.
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

, their average halo-centric radius show little indication of an orbit.
 This is probably due to major mergers and violent relaxation afterwards.

 the prediction gave a smaller halo-centric radius for more massive host

Note that the accretion redshift we use is the redshift that the subhalo
 is accreted most recently, but not all the subhalos stay inside of their
 host halos after accretion.
 There are some subhalos which move out from their host halos.
 Those halos are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ejected halos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and treating them as host halos or subhalos alter the clustering on small
 scales (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wetzel_etal13,sunayama16"

\end_inset

).
 Even though those ejected halos are outside of the virial radius, they
 are likely to be gravitationally bound and are accreted again.
 Some of the subhalos in the samples follow that scenario.
 So, we use the first accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

, which is the redshift that the subhalo is accreted first time, and repeat
 the same analysis done for Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:radial_massDependence"

\end_inset

 and Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 Here, we use the subhalos whose host halo masses are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$
\end_inset

, but the same result holds for the subhalos with different host halo masses.
 The left panel of Fig.

 They do not show any significant differences up to 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.4$

\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$

\end_inset

 larger than the one for 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.4$
\end_inset

.
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.4$
\end_inset

, we preferentially select subhalos which are more tightly bound to their
 host halos (because they never move out after accretion) and this is why
 the average radius is smaller for the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$

\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$

 By using the first accretion redshift, the radial distribution becomes
 less concentrated.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate the correlation between the accretion redshift
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and the retained mass and maximum circular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}$
\end_inset

 are the subhalo mass/maximum circular velocity at present (in this case,
 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

 are the subhalo mass/maximum circular velocity at accretion.
 The retained mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 measures the mass loss after subhalos are accreted by their host halos,
 and it is tightly correlated with the accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 due to tidal stripping.
 As a general trend, subhalos which are accreted earlier experience more
 mass loss because they stay in their host halos longer.
 The question is how well this property 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 correlates with the accretion redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that we use the subhalos in the host halos whose masses are greater
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 as well as with 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,acc}}$
\end_inset

 are the maximum circular velocity at present time and at accretion.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

 are tightly correlated with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is expected, because the subhalos which are accreted earlier must
 be striped more mass due to tidal stripping.
 Quantitatively, the cross correlation coefficients for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 is 0.651, while it is 0.403 for the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

.
 As is clear from the figures, the change in halo mass is larger than the
 change in the maximum circular velocity.
 This is mostly because approximately the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max}}\propto M_{{\rm vir}}^{1/3}$
\end_inset

 holds.
 Applying this scaling relation and converting 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$
\end_inset

, the slope for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 is almost the same as the slope for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{{\rm max,sub}}/V_{{\rm acc,sub}}$

 is consistent.

 The figure shows that the position and mass loss are tightly correlated
 for the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

 to stronger tidal field).
 On the other hand, subhalos with

\end_inset

 show almost no correlation between their radial profiles and mass losses.
 This is because those subhalos are accreted early enough that their distributio

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we investigate how segregation on radial profiles appear
 in observational signature using two-point correlation functions, particularly
 in redshift-space.
 Small-scale redshift-space distortions have potential to test General Relativit
y/modified gravity.
 Several studies [
\color red
cite: zu et al.
\color inherit
] show that infall kinematics of clusters can differ by 
\begin_inset Formula $10-20\%$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $f(R)$
\end_inset

/Galileon modified gravity and General Relativity.
 Often the modified gravity models provide larger velocity dispersions,
 which generate different scale-dependence on the redshift-space correlation
 functions on small scales.
 So, it is important to understand how particular selection of galaxies/subhalos
 alter the small-scale clustering in redshift-space, since this can be a
 potential syatemtic error in the measurements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first select host halos whose masses are greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$
\end_inset

, and then subsample the subhalos based on 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 Unlike the radial profiles, we do not normalize the distances between the
 subhalos and the corresponding host halos by the virial radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 to compute correlation functions.
 So, using host halos with different mass ranges will change the clustering
 signals on small scales, but the generic trend of segregation remains the
 same.
 In all that follows, we will use 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{sub,sub}$
\end_inset

 to denote the auto-correlation of the subhalos and their host halos, and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{mm}$
\end_inset

 for the matter auto-correlation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first compute the correlation functions in real-space to see how well
 we can see the segregation on correlation functions without normalizing
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 and with 2-halo terms.
 The left panel of Fig.

 cluster more strongly than the ones with

Next, we compute the correlation functions in redshift-space.
 The coordinates in redshift-space are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{s}\equiv\vec{r}+\frac{v_{\parallel}}{H_{0}}\hat{r}_{\parallel},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{r}$
\end_inset

 is the position in real-space, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 is the line-of-sight component of the peculiar velocity and the unit vector
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{o}$
\end_inset

 is the Hubble constant.
 The peculiar velocity along the line-of-sight direction generates anisotropy
 in the density field and therefore angular dependence 
\color red
on
\color inherit
 the correlation functions.
 Using the angle between a subhalo pair and the line-of-sight direction
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, we xompute the 2D correlation functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{s}(s,\mu)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\equiv cos\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we project the 2D correlation functions onto Legendre polynomials
 to compute monopole and quadrupole terms such as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi_{s}^{(0)}(s)=\int d\mu\xi_{s}(s,\mu)L_{0}(\mu),
\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi_{s}^{(2)}(s)=\int d\mu\xi_{s}(s,\mu)L_{2}(\mu),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}(\mu)$
\end_inset

 are the zeroth-order and second-order Legendre polynomials.
 The left panel of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:auto_sub-redshift"

\end_inset

 shows the monopole term of the subhalo auto-correlation functions, while
 the right panel shows the quadrupole terms.
 For the monopole terms, the segregation signal is completely smeared out
 and the correlation functions for each sample is almost indistinguishable;
 however, the quadrupole term shows different scale-dependence for each
 sample more clearly.
 This implies that those two subsamples of subhalos have different velocity
 dispersions on small scales (i.e., different Finger-of-God effect).
 To take a closer look at this, we first plot the correlation functions
 for various

For every halo in the Bolshoi catalogs, we use its tabulated 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$

 to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}(M_{{\rm vir}}),$
\end_inset

 and then use the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$

 to compare with the measured concentration for every halo.
 We will henceforth refer to halos with 
\begin_inset Formula $c<\bar{c}(M_{{\rm vir}})$

 We use concentration as an indicator of assembly history: Ref.

 late-forming halos.

 While the subhalos with

 The subhalos in the high concentration host halos show steeper decrease
 as the distance gets closer to the virial radius.
 If the distribution of the early-accreted subhalos is virialized (

how could I phrase this correctly?

 The another way of explaining this phenomenon is that the high-concentration
 halos have a deeper potential depth and therefore their subhalos are more

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we investigate environmental effects on segregation of subhalos
 using the accretion redshift.
 We first study whether the segregation on radial profiles show any dependences
 on the host halo mass.
 Then, we further explore whether assembly history of host halos affect
 the radial distributions.
 In addition to them, we also computed two-point correlation functions for
 samples of subhalos (split by 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

) as its expected observational signature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude this chapter with the following summary of our findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Segregation of subhalos on radial profiles is independent of host halo mass.
 Until subhalos complete their first 
\color red
orbiting
\color inherit
 (i..e, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

), they show clear characteristic of an orbit (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:halo_centric1"

\end_inset

).
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

, their average halo-centric radius is almost the same for any 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 (possibly) due to major mergers and the violent relaxation.
 Since the segregation is independent of the host halo mass, we can measure/comp
are this to galaxy segregation for clusters as well as groups.
 The generic trend is consistent with the findings in Ref.

For the subhalos with

\end_inset

, using 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

 give little difference on the radial distributions, while the average halo-cent
ric radius based on 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $10\%$
\end_inset

 larger than the one using 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

 at

 In terms of galaxy formation, galaxy property may be more correlated with
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc,first}}$
\end_inset

, and comparing our finding to observations can be a good test to tell which
 accretion redshift is more important for galaxy formation.

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 are correlated, we test how much of segregation actually comes from 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm vir}}/m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 by generating samples with the same dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$
\end_inset

, subhalos which lost more mass are preferentially closer to the center,
 while there is no correlation between the amount of mass loss and the radial
 distribution for the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$

\begin_layout Enumerate
We found that assembly history of host halos do not affect the radial distributi

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, the subhalos with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}>0.5$
\end_inset

 show weak dependence on the concentration of their host halos; the inner
 region does not show any difference, while the outer region shows some
 amplitude difference.

We found that the subhalos with

 have the almost twice large amplitude for the redshift-space correlation
 functions at the most inner region compared to that for the subhalos with
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{{\rm acc}}<0.5$

 This is because the subhalos with

 have almost 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$

 This will tell us whether galaxy property (such as color) is correlated
 with

 or

.
 Also, we can extend our analysis with assembly bias by using other parameters
 such as spin (which is a good indicator of recent mergers).
 In observations, some clusters/groups probably experience recent mergers.
 In order to compare the result from simulations to observations, it is
 good to know how merger changes the radial distribution of subhalos and
 affects the segregation.

 shows unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions for high/low-concentration
 host halos.
 Note that the unevolved subhalo mass function implies that we use the subhalo
 mass at accretion, while we use the subhalo mass at present time for the
 evolved subhalo mass function.
 Both subhalo mass functions indicate that the subhalo mass functions for
 high-concentration halos have fewer subhalos for 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm acc}}/M_{{\rm vir}}>10^{-1.5}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{{\rm acc}}$
\end_inset

 is the subhalo mass at accretion and 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{{\rm vir}}$
\end_inset

 is the host halo mass at present.

-> I wanted to say that high-concentration halos tend to live in under-dense
 regions and therefore the amplitude of the subhalo mass function is smaller
 than the one for low-concentration halos.

 We use the host halos whose masses are greater than

\end_inset

 and split them based on their concentrations.
 The blue lines are the subhalos whose host halos have high concentration,
 while the green lines are for low concentration.
 (Remake the figure without plotting the circles+ I should choose host halos
 with more mass range; also should I use MD instead of Bolshoi?)

 To compute the NFW profiles, we use the median concentration of each sample;
 4.767 for the low-concentration halos and 7.446 for the high-concentration
 halos.
 We see the similar trend on the outer region that the subhalos in the low-conce
ntration halos have higher amplitude than the ones for the high-concentration
 halos.
 Overall profiles between NFW profiles and subhalos are consistent with
 the finding in XXX [
